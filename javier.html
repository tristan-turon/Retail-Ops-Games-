    <P>This page is dedicated to Javier, the retail operations team, and everyone who made our internship such an incredible experience. We, the interns, want to take a moment to thank you for the last 10 weeks and what they’ve meant to us.</P>
    <p>As young adults, this internship was one of our first steps into the professional world, and it’s left a lasting impression on how we view work and our relationships within a company. We didn’t just learn professional skills; we grew personally and relationally, too. Whether it was giving back to the community or working on Excel sheets, we learned that patience and communication are key.</p>

    <p>From organizing events to mastering various software platforms, we picked up a wide range of skills that will stick with us for life. More importantly, we learned that the unity of a team is what makes work enjoyable. No one wants to go to work and be miserable, and we’ve seen firsthand how a supportive team can make all the difference.</p>
    <p>Now, as we head into the Office Olympics, it’s every team for themselves! May the best team win, and remember to have fun along the way. Thanks again for everything! Sincerely, The Interns: Reema, Tristan, Bella, Anistyn</p>
